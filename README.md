# StatLearningBigData_Project4

This project continues with the prediction question(s) considered in the last project, but uses neural networks to model the outcome.  This project also asks students to compare their results to those in the last project. The data set I chose for this class was the Hotel Booking Data Set published by Nuno Antonio, Ana de Almeida and Luis Nunes. This data set features booking information for 119k hotel reservations. The data was gathered directly from hotel property management system databases using SQL Server Studio Manager, and contains 32 attributes. 

# Report Details
The assignment requested the  following information:  

Introduction:  
Remind me briefly about your data  
Recap performance of previous prediction models.  

Modeling:  
How will you set your network architecture and why?   
Talk about the complexity of the model and underlying optimization problem. Do you expect the model to overfit? If so, how will you control overfitting?
When considering multiple approaches or when pivoting to a new setup, how will you compare models?  
What do you notice about the results? Comment on anything that matches what you expected given your work in the previous projects and anything surprising.   
Are there any new questions that were raised by the results?  
Be sure to include appropriate figures, tables, or summaries.  

Evaluation:   
How “good” of a model were you able to produce?   
Would you recommend using this model to predict your outcome?  
Interpret any evaluation metrics used and put these numbers in the context of your data.   
If your model performs very well, why do you think this model was a good fit? If your model does not perform very well, are there any clues as to why this is?   
How do these results compare to the models you used in project 3? How does this match your understanding of the different models?  

Conclusion:  
Summarize what you learned about your data through this project.
